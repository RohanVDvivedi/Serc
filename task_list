 * ssl support for http client (* future)
 * use a per connection memory allocator for the server (* future)
 * use conatins_dstring KMP based substring analyzer for pattern matching based routing logic
 * need to increase efficieny of the http parser, lesser copy/concatenate calls, do lesser copy of characters from servers dstring to build the parse tree, instead use a single copy of the dstring and make dummy dstring to point to it, essentially making less copy operation to build the parse tree (i.e. no need to replicate all the data, this will also result into lesser memory allocation calls)
 * stronger adherence to HTTP standard headers and make server to act accordingly, instead of relying on the user/application developer to do it correctly
    * range query
    * web sockets
