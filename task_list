 * ssl support for http client (* future)
 * use a per connection memory allocator for the server (* future)
 * use conatins_dstring KMP based substring analyzer for pattern matching based routing logic
 * advanced thread management (* future)
   * current system
     * 1 thread per connection
   * updated system
     * 2 threads per connection for io
       * 1 for reading requests from network and pushing to the processing fixed thread pool
       * 1 for writing generated responses (by processing requests) to the network
     * A completely separate fixed thread count, thread pool for processing the requestsm and push the generated reponse to the respective queue to be sent to the network
   * advanced system
     * convert the 2 thread model to async io
   (the updated and advanced threading model will provide continuous request processing to generate responses)
