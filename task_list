 * use distributed/controller return statement to continue or exit the connection handler loop
 * request and response objects encapsulate the parse states within them, and they get dispatched as soon as headers are read completely -> this enables us to further provide support for web sockets and streaming responses
 * add support for AOP by providing list of before and after function lists in the json file
 * store the complete http header string and make path, parameter and headers dstrings to point to this dstring
 * stronger adherence to HTTP standard headers and make server to act accordingly, instead of relying on the user/application developer to do it correctly
    * range query
    * web sockets
 * support file browsing
 * provide access to file cache inside the controller

 * ssl support for http client (* far future)
 * use a per connection memory allocator for the server (* far future)
