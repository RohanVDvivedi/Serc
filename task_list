 Tasks picked

* file request resolution controller
 * logic to serve folders if requested
 * implement range query for bytes in files
 * write logic to automatically pick content-encoding from any of the supported accept encoding
 * test logic to check if content-type is supported in the accept header before sending a file

* add funcions to quickly initialize http request and response object in HTTPparser

* distributer
 * revamp python logic
 * add default 404 handler case





 * use HTTPparser library and ConnMan's stream extension 

 * use client_set with ssl support for http clients
 * pass stream and parsed http request to handler functions
 * request gets dispatched to distributer as soon as headers are read completely -> this enables us to further provide support for web sockets and streaming responses

 * Discard
   httprequest, httpresponse, zlib compression wrapper, and http_* logic except certain helper methods like add default server headers etc

 * update controller logic

 * stronger adherence to HTTP standard headers and make server to act accordingly, instead of relying on the user/application developer to do it correctly
    * range query
    * web sockets
 * support file browsing
